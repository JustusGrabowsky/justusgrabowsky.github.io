Supervised by **Nicola Spaldin** and **Mathieu Luisier** at ETH Zürich, I generated a DFT dataset and trained a neural-network interatomic potential for BaTiO₃ using DeePMD-kit.  
The model reproduces bulk energies and captures structural distortions relevant to ferroelectric transitions, serving as a foundation for active-learning extensions.
