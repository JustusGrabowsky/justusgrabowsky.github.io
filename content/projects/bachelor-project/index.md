During my research stay at **École Normale Supérieure (ENS Paris)**, I worked with Carlo Sirtori on ultra-strong light-matter coupling. In the ultra-strong regime, the coupling strength becomes comparable to the transition energy itself, enabling novel quantum phenomena.

The project focused on metamaterial LC-resonators operating in the terahertz frequency range. We first simulated the electromagnetic properties and resonance behavior using finite-element simulations, confirming the expected scaling relations and field confinement between capacitor plates. We then fabricated the devices in the cleanroom using standard semiconductor processing techniques: electron-beam lithography with PMMA resist, physical vapor deposition of titanium/gold layers, and silicon nitride insulation. The sample contained approximately 20,000 individual omega-shaped resonators on a GaAs substrate. For characterization, terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) was performed to measure the resonance frequencies and absorption behavior. By introducing an immersion lens to the setup, we successfully improved the visibility of the resonance, achieving nearly 60% absorption at the resonant frequency. The work revealed interesting deviations between simulated and measured resonance frequencies, likely due to fabrication tolerances in the insulator thickness, and provided hands-on experience with nanofabrication and ultrafast optics.
