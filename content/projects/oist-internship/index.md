At the **Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology (OIST)**, I joined the **Femtosecond Spectroscopy Unit (FSU)** led by *Prof. Keshav Dani*.  
My work focused on angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) of 2D materials and the development of optical setups for time-resolved measurements.  
Independently, I designed and built a **fourth-harmonic generation (FHG)** system for use in pump–probe spectroscopy, contributing to the lab’s nonlinear optical characterization capabilities.
