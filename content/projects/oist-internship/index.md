During summer 2023, I joined the **Femtosecond Spectroscopy Unit (FSU)** at the **Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology (OIST)**, led by Keshav Dani. The group combines ultrafast laser technology with low-dimensional materials to study light-matter interactions with femtosecond temporal and nanometer spatial resolution.

My work focused on two main projects. First, we performed angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements on 2D materials to map their electronic band structure and explore momentum-space exciton dynamics. ARPES provided direct access to the momentum-resolved electronic properties that determine these materials' optical and transport behavior. In parallel, I designed and built a fourth-harmonic generation (FHG) setup to produce deep-UV pulses for pump-probe experiments. This involved optimizing nonlinear frequency conversion in BBO crystals and carefully managing beam alignment and dispersion compensation. The setup expanded the lab's capabilities for time-resolved spectroscopy and contributed to ongoing studies of ultrafast carrier dynamics in nanomaterials.
