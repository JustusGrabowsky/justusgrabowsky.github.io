At Yale University, I carried out my Master’s thesis under the supervision of **Diana Qiu** (Yale) and **Juan Carrasquilla** (ETH Zürich).  
The project focused on computing quasiparticle energies and excitonic spectra of the layered magnetic semiconductor CrSBr.  
I implemented a full GW–BSE workflow combining Quantum ESPRESSO with BerkeleyGW, analyzed frequency-dependent dielectric functions, and studied spin-dependent optical transitions.
