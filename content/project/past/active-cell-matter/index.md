During my exchange at ENS Paris, I worked with Cécile Sykes and Julie Plastino on actin-based motility. Actin-based motility is a fundamental mechanism underlying cell movement and shape changes. 

I studied the dynamics of VCA-coated micrometric polystyrene beads that polymerize actin on their surface, generating propulsive forces and forming characteristic "actin comets." The project involved preparing protein solutions and coating beads, observing their movement under phase-contrast microscopy, and performing quantitative tracking and statistical analysis of bead trajectories and velocities.

Interestingly, our results showed that larger (4.5 μm) beads exhibited higher velocities than smaller (1 μm) beads, contradicting previous findings. We attributed this to spatial confinement effects under our experimental conditions.
