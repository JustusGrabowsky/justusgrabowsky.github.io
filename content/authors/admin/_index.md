I am a PhD student at the Institute of Neuroinformatics at ETH Zürich & UZH working on the neural dynamics of speech under the supervision of Timothée Proix. My reserach focuses on investigating how speech features are represented and combined in the brain to form a unified meaning. Previously, I was a visiting researcher at Yale University, where I worked on theoretical condensed matter physics with Diana Qiu. I hold a Bachelor's and a Master's degree in Physics from ETH Zürich. Learn more about my current and past [research](/projects/).
